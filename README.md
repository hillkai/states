# states
Reads information (using file i/o) about states and their counties, sorts through the information and either prints it to the screen or writes it to the file. The program finds the state with the largest population, the county with the largest population, the counties with an income above a specific amount (decided by the user), the average household cost for all counties in each state, the states in sorted order by name, the counties within states sorted by population, the counties withing states sorted by name.

To run program you must make an executable by running the makefile. The program also requires command line arguments. Put a -s followed by how many states you want to use (the file I provided has 10 states) then a -f followed by the name of the file you want to read from. Ex: state_facts -s 3 -f states.txt
